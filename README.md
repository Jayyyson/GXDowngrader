<h1> GXDowngrader </h1>
Downgrades any GX app to a set version. Not normally possible on a vanilla GX.
<p>  </p>
<h2> Warning </h2>
I (Jayyyson), am not responsible for the uses of this program. It can be used for going back to a time where the "free trial" of the game didn't exist, to get it for free, you can use it for nostalagia, or even to break the entire game. I cannot prevent that in any way.

<h2> Installation </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3> For normal users: </h3>

Releases tab.
<h3> For experienced/careful users: </h3>

Compile the source code yourself in C++.


<h2> How to use </h2>

Enter a directory of the GX game (Usually C:\users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\GameFix\Games\(your game here), or drag and drop the "VerHistory.gxjpx" file into the window. Then select a version out of the displayed ones.

<h1> CAUTION </h1>

This esentially reinstalls the whole game, so you can loose something stored locally (game progress and singeplayer is stored locally, but GX automatically keeps a backup of it on their servers every time you run a game.)
